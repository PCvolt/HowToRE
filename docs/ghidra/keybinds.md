## Keybinds
I recommend to change some keybinds for making your life easier when navigating the decompiled code: ``Edit > Tool Options... > Key Bindings`` and edit the following

- Previous in History Buffer: change Alt+Left to Ctrl+Left
- Next in History Buffer: change Alt+Right to Ctrl+Right
- Find References To Symbol: set it to Shift+F

These three features are the core of a smooth search in Ghidra.
