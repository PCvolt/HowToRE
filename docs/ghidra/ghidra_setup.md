## Setting up Ghidra
Get the version of your choice here: [Ghidra Github Releases](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/releases)

### Get Java JRE and JDK
- Install Java JRE (any version should do).
- For Ghidra 9.1.2 (the one that I use), install between JDK11 and JDK15. Ghidra 10 should support between JDK17 and JDK20.
