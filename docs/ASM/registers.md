## Registers
- ``EAX`` is commonly used to store the **return value** (very important!)
- ``EBX`` to ``EDI`` are general-purposes registers
- ``ESP`` is the **Stack Pointer**, it points to the top of the stack
- ``EBP`` is the **Base Pointer**, it is set at ``ESP`` at the beginning of a function (beginning of a stack frame)
- ``EIP`` is the **Instruction Pointer**, which points to the next instruction to execute in the code
