ParentClass vtable's pointers to destructor() and virtualFunction() are different from the ones in ChildClass' vtable. Even if we call it a table, a vtable is a list of function pointers, hence why the addresses of each function is incremented by 0x4. The first pointer of a vtable ALWAYS points to the destructor! (write in red) Here, at 0x85A3C4. Why? When a class is created, even if the destructor is not explicitly defined, the compiler generates a default destructor. That is, all inheriting classes will inherit this destructor! Constructors are not in the vtable however, as they cannot be virtual. Note: the destructor may be non-virtual (therefore not part of the vtable), but that is quite unsafe when dealing with derived classes because of unproper cleanups! Here, most of the guesswork has already been done, but the functions here are natively named FUN_<ADDRESS> .
